    "# Using the local password manager\n",
    "\n",
    "The package `psypwdm` is a local password manager serving to locally, securely and conveniently store passwords to personal systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The password manager is intended to be used with the relational database PostgreSQL (which can be downloaded [here](https://www.postgresql.org/)), so please ensure this is installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we will walk through the process required to initialise the password manager table in the postgres databse, how to insert and retrieve entries and how to delete the table. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note** *The password itself will not be stored, only its `SHA256` hash, salted appropriately. This means if you forget a password, you cannot simply read it off from a stored entry, however you can try to guess what the password is through the `retrieve_for_pwd` function discussed later.* \n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "Installing the password manager `psypwdm` is straightforward. It can be pip installed with the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ pip install psypwdm\n",
    "\n",
    "With PostgreSQL up and running, simply importing `psypwdm` will create the password manager table as follows."
